# MIR_Deep_Learning
This repository contains all the code project from the Deep Learning courses in Master MIR

In TP_01 code, I mainly exploring on how to use PyTorch to make a Multi Layer Perceptron Model.

In TP_02 code, I delve deeper into the implementation of MLP to classify MNIST dataset.

In TP_03 code, I implement Convolutional Neural Network algorithm to classify MNIST dataset. I also do a transfer learning method, using a pre-trained models to classify fish species given the respective image dataset.

In TP_Object_Detection code, I implement R-CNN algorithm to detect maritime object such as boat, ship, sail, kayak, etc.

In dl4sequences code, I explore on Recurrent Neural Network, Long-Short Term Memory, and Transformer model on sequential data to perform a parity test.
